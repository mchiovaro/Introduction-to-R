## Description

Welcome to "Introduction to R", a course on using R in the quantitative social sciences!

The course is structured as a series to R Markdown documents. R Markdown documents contain regular text and "chunks" of code. In the text, I guide you through the lesson, giving specific instructions on what to do. In the code "chunks", I provide the correct code in case you get stuck. To get the most out of each lesson, try to refrain from looking at the chunk unless you get stuck. Alternatively, you can make a copy of the R Markdown document and remove the code chunks entirely.

As with most technical skills, practice makes perfect! I suggest re-doing the most recent lesson at least one additional time before our next class.
